# reflekt
Reflekt is an intelligent reflected XSS vulnerability scanner that uses context-aware detection to minimize false positives. Unlike traditional scanners that blindly inject payloads, Reflekt first understands where your input lands in the response and then crafts minimal probes to verify actual exploitability.
